I was afraid that the glass lens of the big 8" Trail Tech headlight would get broken, so to protect it I bought some 1/16" thick clear polycarbonate sheet and cut out a disc the same size as the headlight's outer frame.

I drilled 6 holes in the plastic disc and attached it to the frame with tie wraps.  I doesn't really show in the photo, but that big piece of clear plastic just makes that big headlight look even bigger -- I think it looks really good.

The difficulty of having a screen or cover over the headlight is actually cleaning the headlight lens itself. If there was a way to hinge the cover so cleaning would be carried out without disturbing the cover itself, that would be great! I used to have a sports car rock shield on my ADV /2 that had a hinge on it but can't seem to find them anymore.

Pokie, I usually just spray some water between the headlight cover and the lens to clean things up.  If I need to do some real cleaning I'll cut a few of the tie wraps to get a rag in there.  The idea of the thing is that there is a gap between the cover and the lens, and with the six tie wraps holding the cover tightly to the frame it would take a considerable force to get back to the lens and crack it.

I needed to do a few things on the swingarm.  The swingarm normally vents through the transmission.  There is a small groove in the bore of the transmission output bearing that achieves this.  I filled that groove with sealer so if the bike fell over in a strange angle oil wouldn't flow though the groove, either from the swingarm to the transmission, or from the transmission to the swingarm.

To make the swingarm vent I drilled a hole at the top of the swingarm and got this 90 degree plastic fitting and some clear hose from the hardware store.

I attached the vent tube with some J-B Weld epoxy and a tie wrap and once the swingarm was installed ran the tube up to the battery box and attached it there with another tie wrap.

The brake cable runs on the outside of the swingarm, and it needed a guide so it would be less likely to get snagged by something on the trail or get hung up on the bolt of the lower shock mount.  I used some #10 (4.9mm) wire and made up this guide.

Here's the finished look with it welded to the swingarm.  Its long enough to handle the whole travel of the suspension.

As I mentioned in a previous post, my plan was to make a hole in the front fender to allow air to pass thorough it and into the oil cooler mounted behind.  I started with a 1" hole saw and made these four holes.

Then, using a jigsaw with a fine tooth blade I made the cutout and cleaned up the edges with a file.

Here's a view of the mounted fender with the oil cooler behind.  I used it for a while with just the bare hole, but as can be seen in the photo little pieces of stuff would get throne into the cooler and stuck there.

I got some heavy grade galvanized steel roof gutter screening and riveted a piece of it to the inner side of the fender.  It can't be seen in this photo, but the screen is in place with four small washers.

Much better with the screen. I got to the third pic and thought "now stuff will get stuck in the cooler fins" Then I kept reading....;-)
